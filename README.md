Hi there! I am a computational linguist and entrepreneur based in Stockholm. My goal is to be an entrepreneur, but for now, I am looking to generate income and improve my skills as a software developer while exploring the tech startup world. 

With a background in linguistics and a passion for programming, I have expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis. In addition to my technical skills, I am also a proficient writer and translator, and have experience teaching and creating content.

I am excited to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact. Thank you for considering my profile.
