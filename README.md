I'm a computational linguist and entrepreneur based in Stockholm. My goal is to be an entrepreneur, but I am currently improving my skills as a software developer.

With a background in linguistics and enthusiasm for programming, most of my knowledge and experience has to do with Python and computational linguistics, and some natural language processing. In addition to my technical skills, I am a solid writer and translator, and have experience teaching English.

I would love to apply my skills, learn and grow with other professionals, and contribute to projects that make people’s lives easier. I really value software that is fast, effective, stable, reliable, and enjoyable to use. I spend a lot of time thinking about design, from the technical elements up to the user interface.

Thank you for considering my profile. You can find out more about my work and services on Fiverr and Patreon *(works in progress)*, and stay tuned for my upcoming Stack Overflow profile. Thank you for your time.
